# Smart Agriculture In Remote Areas
There are many IoT system in agriculture domain and they are helping the farmers to make complex decisions about crops and reducing the human efforts.
But in India there are many remote places where internet facility is not available, due to lack of internet of facility fields data cannot be send to cloud server for analysis. So IoT based agriculture seems difficult in remote areas so this system basically developed to apply IoT in remote areas. 
This system uses the concept of drones to collect the data from the fields and send it to the cloud server for analysis. Cloud server will analyze this field’s data using machine learning techniques and farmer will get predictions and decisions along with the data on android application.
There are still many remote places in India where the internet facility is not available so this system can help the farmer to apply internet of the things in agriculture in such places. The decisions which this system made are very helpful for the farmer, farmer can take benefits from the system and increase the yield.
This system also monitor the irrigation system i.e once the prediction is made that fields requires irrigation water pump will start automatically and once the water level reached at predefine threshold water pump will automatically turned off. All decisions and data farmer can access on his personal android application.
There are many decisions which system is going make by analyzing the field’s data these are as follows.
# 1.	Weather Irrigation is required for the particular field or not.
# 2.	What is the best crop for the particular fields?
# 3.	What is the best time of sowing?
These all decisions are in ordered to increase the productivity of fields.
